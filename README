I implemented the stuff in this guide: http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-android-other-platforms/hockeyapp-for-android-ndk-early-access

Its a plugin for MOAI according to the structure for plugins set up by Halfnelson.

There are two java files that you need to manually add to your java host, one is original hockey app code, and the other is my little wrapper.

Change the hockey app ID in HockeyAppHandler.java to match your account

Then use the wrapper by calling from your activity
  handler = new HockeyAppHandler(this); 
  handler.init();
  handler.checkForCrashes();

The java stuff in HockeyAppHandler is very crude so you need to look at it and modify according to your needs

Read up on using plugins somewhere else, I'm in a hurry :)
